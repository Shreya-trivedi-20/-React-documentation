JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript syntax that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript code. It is a syntax extension that makes 
it easier to write and manipulate HTML elements and React components.

JSX is not a separate language but a syntax extension that gets transformed into regular JavaScript by a transpiler (such as Babel) before it's executed in the browser.

JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript code, making it easier to read and write code that creates UI elements.
