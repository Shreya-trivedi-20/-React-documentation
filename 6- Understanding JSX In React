JSX (JavaScript XML) is an extension to JavaScript syntax that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript code. It is a syntax extension that makes 
it easier to write and manipulate HTML elements and React components.

JSX is not a separate language but a syntax extension that gets transformed into regular JavaScript by a transpiler (such as Babel) before it's executed in the browser.

JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript code, making it easier to read and write code that creates UI elements. 

JSX Example :

const jsx = <h1>This is JSX</h1>

This is simple JSX code in React. But the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code. This is because we're assigning an HTML tag 
to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.

So to convert it to browser understandable JavaScript code, we use a tool like Babel which is a JavaScript compiler/transpiler.

We can use the above JSX in our React code like this:

class JSXDemo extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>This is JSX</h1>;
    }
}

ReactDOM.render(<JSXDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));

Here, we're returning the JSX from the JSXDemo component and rendering that on the screen using the ReactDOM.render method.
