COMPONENTS - 

In React, components are functions or classes that return React elements  which can be rendered to the screen. 

Example :

function Greeting ()

{

return 

<h1> " Hey , how are you ?? " </h1> 

}

Explanation :

This is a functional component that returns an h1 element with the text "Hello, world!".

In this example, the component doesn't take any props as input. It simply returns the same output every time it's called. It can be used in other components or in a 
React app as-is.

Greeting function is the component. It's a functional component that returns some markup (in this case, an h1 element with the text "Hello, world!").

In React, components are functions or classes that return React elements (markup) which can be rendered to the screen. In this case, the Greeting function is a
