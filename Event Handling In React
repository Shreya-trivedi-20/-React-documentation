Event handling in React refers to the way in which React components handle user-generated events, such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, or touch events. React provides
a simple and intuitive way to handle events using its built-in event system.

In React, event handling is done by defining event handlers as functions that are bound to particular events. Event handlers are defined as methods within a React
component, and they are passed as props to the child components that need to handle those events.
